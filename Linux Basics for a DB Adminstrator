Eg: vi <filename> and enter the contents and exit using :wq!
4. mkdir : create a directory

Changing Password:
1. change password using command --> passwd userid [Only root can use this].
2. If already connected as that user just use command -->passwd.

File and Directory permissions:
1. UNIX multi user system , Every file can be accessed by different users based on permissions.
2. Permissions for a file are of 3 types:
      1. r : read
      2. w : write
      3. x : execute
3. Each permission can be controlled by 3 levels:
      1. u : user 
      2. g : group
      3. o : other
4. File / Directory permissions can be checked by running ls -l
5. Command to change permission is 'chmod'.

Eg : 
-rw-r--r--    1 nehakorukula  staff      188 Oct 18  2023 file.txt
User nehakorukula has only read and write permissions
Group staff has only access to read
others , all other users have only read permissions.
===================
Adding write permissions to group , adding execute to other and remove write permissions from user.
chmod g+w file.txt
chmod o+x file.txt
chmod u-w file.txt
-r--rw-r-x  1 nehakorukula  staff  188 Oct 18  2023 file.txt
=====================
Remove read permissions from all of them
chmod a-r file.txt
-----w---x  1 nehakorukula  staff  188 Oct 18  2023 file.txt
=====================
User to have all the permissions and group and other only read.
chmod u+rwx file.txt     
chmod g-w+r file.txt
chmod o-x+r file.txt
-rwxr--r--  1 nehakorukula  staff  188 Oct 18  2023 file.txt
