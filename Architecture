Architectural components
1. MySQL server process
2. Client programs connecting locally or remotely.
3. Other MySQL programs (not clients) installed locally.

--> Client programs connect to MySQL server process to make data requests.

Client-Server connectivity:
Is not limited to environments where all computers run the same OS.
Client programs can connect to the server running on the same host or diff host.

MySQL server processess:
1. mysqld
2. Runs as a single process that is multithreaded.
3. Manages access to dbs on disk and in memory.
4. Supports simultaneous client connections.
5. Supports multiple storage engines.
6. Supports both transactional and non-transactional tables.
7. Optimizes memory usage by using caches and buffers.

Host : Physical machine or virtual machine on which server program runs , which includes hardware configuration , OS and its N/W addr.
MySQL server Software : A software program (mysqld) with a version number and a list of features.
MySQL server Instance : A mysqld server process that manages data directory containing one or more schemas.
                        [Multiple instances can run on a single host]

Classic protocols and X protocols
--> MySQL classic protocol , MySQL X Protocol introduced in MySQL .7.12 and enabled by default in MySQL 8.0.
TCP/IP protocol -> local/remote connections -> Supports classic and X protocol -> Works on all OS.
Socket file -> Local connections -> Supports classic and X protocol -> UNIX-derived OS including Linux , BSD, Mac OS X.
Shared memory -> local connections -> classic protocol -> Windows OS
Named pipes -> local connections -> classic protocal -> Windows OS

Local and Remote Connection protocol :
TCP/IP (Transmission control protocol/Internet Protocol):
-> Uses IP addresses or DNS host name to identify hosts.
-> Uses TCP port numbers to identify specific services on each host.
-> MySQL default TCP port number:
  1. 3306 -> MySQL Classic Protocol (port)
  2. 33060 -> MySQL X protocol (mysqlx_port)
  3. 33062 -> Administrative connection using MySQL Classic protocol(admin_port).
-> Enables connections between different hosts.
For default port connection:
Eg : mysql --host=<hostname> --user=<username> --password
For using alternative port:
Eg : mysql -h <host/ip> -P 3312 -uroot -p

Local Connection Protocol in Linux : Socket
-> Interprocess communication used to form one end of a bidirectional communication link between 2  processes on the same machine.
