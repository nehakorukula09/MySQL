Security check:
sudo mysql_secure_installation

1. VALIDATE PASSWORD COMPONENT can be used to test passwords
and improve security. It checks the strength of password
and allows the users to set only those passwords which are
secure enough. Would you like to setup VALIDATE PASSWORD component?
2. There are three levels of password validation policy:
LOW    Length >= 8
MEDIUM Length >= 8, numeric, mixed case, and special characters
STRONG Length >= 8, numeric, mixed case, special characters and dictionary                  file
Please set the password for root here.
New password: 
Re-enter new password: 
Estimated strength of the password: 50 
Do you wish to continue with the password provided?(Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : Y

3. By default, a MySQL installation has an anonymous user,
allowing anyone to log into MySQL without having to have
a user account created for them. This is intended only for
testing, and to make the installation go a bit smoother.
You should remove them before moving into a production
environment.

Remove anonymous users? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : Y

4. Normally, root should only be allowed to connect from
'localhost'. This ensures that someone cannot guess at
the root password from the network.

Disallow root login remotely? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : Y
5. By default, MySQL comes with a database named 'test' that
anyone can access. This is also intended only for testing,
and should be removed before moving into a production
environment.


Remove test database and access to it? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : 
6. Reloading the privilege tables will ensure that all changes
made so far will take effect immediately.

Reload privilege tables now? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : y

-> Available on Windows , Linux and Mac OS X.

Benefits:

--> Development tool (Creating , executing and optimizing SQL queries)
--> Administration purposes
--> Visual Performance Dashboard
--> Database Migration

1. Install community version mysql
sudo dnf -y install https://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql84-community-release-el9-1.noarch.rpm
2. sudo dnf install mysql-workbench-community
or 
sudo dnf -y install https://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql-workbench-community-8.0.38-1.el9.x86_64.rpm
Error: 
 Problem: conflicting requests
  - nothing provides libproj.so.22()(64bit) needed by mysql-workbench-community-8.0.38-1.el9.x86_64 from @commandline
(try to add '--skip-broken' to skip uninstallable packages or '--nobest' to use not only best candidate packages)
Fix: 
sudo dnf -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm
Install snaps
Snaps are applications packaged with all their dependencies to run on all popular Linux distributions from a single build. They update automatically and roll back gracefully.
===============================
sudo yum install epel-release
Snap can now be installed as follows:
sudo yum install snapd
Once installed, the systemd unit that manages the main snap communication socket needs to be enabled:
sudo systemctl enable --now snapd.socket
To enable classic snap support, enter the following to create a symbolic link between /var/lib/snapd/snap and /snap:
sudo ln -s /var/lib/snapd/snap /snap
Either log out and back in again, or restart your system, to ensure snap’s paths are updated correctly.
===============================
sudo yum install snapd
sudo systemctl enable --now snapd.socket
sudo ln -s /var/lib/snapd/snap /snap
[ec2-user@ip-~]$ sudo snap install mysql-workbench-community
error: too early for operation, device not yet seeded or device model not acknowledged

Upgrading from MySQL <8.4 to MySQL >9.0 requires running MySQL 8.4 first:
 - brew services stop mysql
 - brew install mysql@8.4
 - brew services start mysql@8.4
 - brew services stop mysql@8.4
 - brew services start mysql
We've installed your MySQL database without a root password. To secure it run:
    mysql_secure_installation
MySQL is configured to only allow connections from localhost by default
To connect run:
    mysql -u root
To start mysql now and restart at login:
  brew services start mysql
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  /opt/homebrew/opt/mysql/bin/mysqld_safe --datadir\=/opt/homebrew/var/mysql
